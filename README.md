I'm Adil Zouitine, a Ph.D. Student in Robust Reinforcement Learning, previously I was Research Engineer.<br />

I have two brothers who make cool stuff, [Mehdi](https://github.com/MehdiZouitine) & [Amine](https://github.com/AmineZouitine) 🤩.

Poem:

*As the moon rises and the stars shine bright,* <br />
*I choose Python 🐍 to code into the night.* <br />
*Its fluid grace and easy flow,* <br />
*Are perfect for exploring where ideas go.* <br />



*But when the dawn breaks and the light reveals,* <br />
*A software solution that truly seals,* <br />
*I choose Rust 	🦀, unwavering and true,* <br />
*For a lifetime of reliability, unwavering and absolute.*
